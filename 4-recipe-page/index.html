            <p>
                Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham
                cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

                <li>
                    Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> <b>Make the crust</b>: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour
                        into
                        a
                        medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all
                        together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and
                        slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan
                        first. I
                        use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes.
                        Remove
                        from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap
                        around
                        the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the
                        filling.</p>

                    <p>

                        <b>Make the filling</b>: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
                        beat
                        the
                        cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the
                        mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and
                        lemon
                        juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating
                        after
                        each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                        mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid
                        over-mixing the batter as best you can.

                        <b>Prepare the simple water bath</b> (see note) Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of
                        water in
                        your
                        roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot
                        water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour
                        the
                        cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
                        even
                        layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of
                        the
                        pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour
                        the
                        hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)

                <li>
                    Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center
                    of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                    the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down
                    for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                    temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
